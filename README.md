# UndeadKing
Fight off hoards of the undead in UndeadKing! Your job is to survive as long as possible! Inspired by the minigame, Journey of the Prairie King in Stardew Valley, UndeadKing is the final project created by me in my Grade 12 CS30 class in Jan 2023.

## Demo

## Objective
Your objective is to fight off continually larger waves of the undead and survive for as long as possible! There are powerups that spawn randomly to assist as well.

## Controls
WASD to move. Spacebar to shoot. Escape to pause.

## Running the Game
This game is built using Greenfoot. Greenfoot is required to be installed in order to play. Simply clone the repository and then open the project.greenfoot file. Greenfoot should load up and you should be able to play the game!
